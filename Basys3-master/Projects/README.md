# Basys3 Github 
This repository provides Digital Design Libraries and Projects targeting the [Xilinx University Program](www.xilinx.com/university) (XUP) [Basys3 board from Digilent](www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,1288&Prod=BASYS3).


The board features an Artix series 7 Xilinx FPGA and is an ideal platform for low cost teaching and student projects.
For questions, please contact the [Xilinx University Program](mailto:xup@xilinx.com).

### XUP_LIB and 74LSXX_LIB
Two libaries of basic logic elements (AND, OR, XOR, muxes etc) for use in Vivado IP Integrator are available. XUP_LIB includes basic logic gates, and 74LSXX_LIB emulates 74LSXX components. These libraries are intended for use in ditial logic teaching and can be used to build bigger projects graphically or schematically in Vivado IP Integrator. 

### Projects
Projects are grouped according to application areas. Currently, **Logic Design** projects are being developed and made available. The Logic Design projects are built from the basic component libraries. 
A library of **Interfaces** will be made available in near future. 

Projects make use of the XUP_LIB and 74LSXX_LIB libraries. It is assumed that you have already downloaded these libraries. 
The projects can be created using the provided Tcl script under each project directory.
